    description: A guided weapon system summoned from the Void Realms by the 2nd
      Herrscher upon awakening. These dual pistols do not fire bullets, but
      "commandments" that tear through the space-time fabric. K423 is the
      perfect vessel designed by Otto for receiving the Herrscher of the Void
      when she returned. However, this vessel exerted a strong influence upon
      the powers of the Herrscher and altered her physical form as well.
