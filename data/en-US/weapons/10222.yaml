    description: A Divine Key weapon made using the core of the 9th Herrscher,
      capable of manipulating gravity itself. Its core component is a sphere
      about 10 cm in diameter. The external stabilizer can be replaced with
      other models with different structures, which adapts this weapon for
      various combat circumstances. When in the form of pistols, the weapon's
      output power is concentrated in a specific direction, making it a potent
      weapon even in the hands of a layman.
