    description: A Pantheon-series fist weapons constructed by Schicksal using
      Soulium. Design features incorporate elements from Chinese mythology, the
      land where Soulium was found. Chinese legends speak of Phoenix, Lord of
      the Birds. The pinions on the gauntlets serve more than decorative
      purposes. When fully extended, they become razor sharp blades that allow
      the wielder to slash her way through.
