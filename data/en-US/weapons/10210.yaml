    description: A weapon from the Previous Era crafted using the core of the 8th
      Herrscher. Despite the fact that its stories as an enigmatic, omnipotent
      "feather" have been told throughout Shenzhou, its true form has always
      remained a mystery. Legend has it that this red down will lead the chosen
      ones into a wonderland where they are free of diseases and sorrows.
