    description: This weapon once belonged to a member of the Twilight Valkyrie
      Squad that once operated in Siberia. This deadly weapon was also designed
      for cold resistance. It was last found impaled on the corpse of a Honkai
      beast during recovery operations, serving as a silent testament to the
      brave warriors who gave their lives fighting.
