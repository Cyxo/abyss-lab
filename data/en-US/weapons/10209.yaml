    name: Might of An-Utu
    description: A primed form of the Key of Destruction formed in the hand of its
      original wielder. The Might of An-Utu is a literal incarnation of the god
      of destruction, and emits a radiance rivaling that of a supernova. Only a
      superhuman warrior is strong enough to harness its infinite reserves of
      destruction.
