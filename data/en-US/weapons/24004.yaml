    description: While the St. 1503 Labs was tirelessly exploring the secrets of the
      Sacred Relics, Schicksal's expedition team found a strange weapon in the
      prehistoric remains in Norway. It roughly resembles the 11th Sacred Relic,
      but is distinctly different at the same time. Every team member who was
      present claimed to have heard the sound of birds flapping their wings. The
      expedition team instantly searched through the remains and finally found
      the word "PRI-ARM" in a tattered file.
