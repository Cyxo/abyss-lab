    name: Zither's Lament
    description: The zither sings for the dearly missed, and fond memories that last
      a thousand years. Some say it's a wonderful instrument that moves
      listeners to tears, while others say it's a deadly weapon with hidden
      blades that shred enemies to pieces. They're probably both true, for it's
      meant to share life's joy and also protect loved ones at all costs.
