    name: Star of Eden
    description: A Divine Key weapon made using the core of the 9th Herrscher
      capable of manipulating gravity itself. First unearthed in the Yellowstone
      Ruins, it was later acquired by scientists of Schicksal North America
      Branch. The weapon played a vital role in the subsequent split and
      independence of Anti-Entropy. Originally furnished with an external
      spherical stabilizer, it was severely damaged during battle in 1955.
      Einstein and Tesla later re-designed this Divine Key into a cannon-like
      device.
