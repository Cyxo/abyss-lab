    description: Enhanced form of M134 Vulcan Minigun. A Honkai-powered rotary
      machine gun modified using the legendary Chiba Academy M134 minigun as the
      base. The modifications were designed to better unleash its destructive
      powers. Once the barrels start spinning, the furious roar of the Kami of
      Fire shall echo throughout the battlefield.
