    description: Standard-issue Valkyrie gauntlets comprising finger and wrist
      portions. Even warriors with no close-quarter combat experiences can
      easily wield these weapons. However, this weapon has limited destructive
      potential and very close range. Few Valkyries will arm themselves with
      these armored gloves. Perhaps someone will eventually master this weapon
      and unleash its true power.
