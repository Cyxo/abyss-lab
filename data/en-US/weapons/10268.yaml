    description: Sword prodigy. Before the girl even knew what the world really is,
      this title was already engraved in her life.\nA long search for a mentor,
      training by the shoal, unpredictable changes in the world, uncertainties
      all around.\nIn this furnace we know as the "world", the girl met and left
      many.\nOnly the determination in her heart and the weapon in her hand are
      her most loyal companions, watching over her for a lifetime.
