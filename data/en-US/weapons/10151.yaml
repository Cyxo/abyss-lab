    description: This Pantheon-series weapon was developed by St. 1504 Labs based on
      super-heavy greatswords. One side of the blade is furnished with two
      mini-propulsion devices, allowing the wielder to unleash explosive bursts
      of power when swinging this weapon. The Valkyrie Assault Squad was
      typically deployed in various treacherous environments. These heavyweight
      greatswords allow them to sweep aside nuisances, living or non-living,
      that get in their way.
