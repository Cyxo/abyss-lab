    description: Manufactured by St. 7308 Labs, these bracers were originally meant
      to be used with other weapons and improve Valkyrie defenses in melee
      combat, and thus feature all-covering and thick armor plates. The sturdy
      yet lightweight gauntlets offer offensive capabilities as well. The
      Chinese name of these gauntlets could mean Jade, or the Halcyon
      Kingfishers. Perhaps its designers wanted the wielder to strike as fast as
      the diving bird.
