    description: The PRI-ARM form of Hyper Railguns. A built-in particle accelerator
      that emits a beam of positrons has been added. The annihilation caused by
      the collision between a positron and an electron will unleash destructive
      power. The discovery of the PRI-ARM technology has opened up a whole new
      world for Anti-Entropy's research on anti-Honkai weapons. However,
      Einstein believes that their understanding of this technology is still at
      an extremely superficial level.
