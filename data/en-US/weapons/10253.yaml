    description: Brought to you by La Vita Nuova, St. 1504 Labs. A passion project
      by director Nagamitsu 18th, this gun is made of soulium and then machine
      gilded to give a charming, aged look. It is currently on display at E.T.
      Studio's exhibition hall. It is cared for by two employees, cleaned once a
      month, with maintenance every other month. Feel free to come check it
      out.\n"Please don't let weapons define St. 1504 Labs' achievements." They
      seek to both preserve tradition and keep up with modern sensibilities —
      This is the Nagamitsu Spirit for the 21st century!
