    name: Whisper of the Past
    description: The weapon of Elysia, the 2nd Flame-Chaser. When she draws the bow,
      the arrow crystallizes on the arrow rest, and after release, it plants a
      magical seed on the target which then becomes a glorious blossom. "I've
      always wondered how Elysia shoots these arrows. Doesn't seem like Honkai
      energy to me. Of course, if you asked her, she'd say 'It's magic!'"
