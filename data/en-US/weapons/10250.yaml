    description: A cross forged by Mobius with the bones of a Judgment-class Honkai
      Beast. When it revealed its venomous fangs for the first time, the
      soldiers on the field went instantly frozen along with the time. They were
      not amazed at another feat of Mobius. They were simply in awe of the
      bone-chilling shadow cast by the snake.
