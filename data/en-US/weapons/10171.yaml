    description: This pair of HAZMAT gloves was developed by ME Corp. Precision
      machining and components allow its wielders to work safely in high
      temperatures, underwater, or even vacuum. However, the elbow portions of
      these HAZMAT gloves seem a tad too heavy. The true purpose of these gloves
      remain... unknown.
