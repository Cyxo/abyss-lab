    description: It was once a sacred katana held in the hands of a miko, until the
      demon of Honkai awakened within the crimson blade. Blood sakura fell as
      the red moon rose. Girls corrupted by the Honkai, streets devoured by
      flames, and petals stained with blood... Everything fell into eternal
      stillness in that raging inferno.
