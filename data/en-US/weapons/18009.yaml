    name: "Star of Eden: Fall"
    description: Key of Devouring empowered by unlocking the Gene Limit. A Divine
      Key weapon made using the core of the 9th Herrscher capable of
      manipulating gravity itself. First unearthed in the Yellowstone Ruins, it
      was later acquired by scientists of Schicksal North America Branch. The
      weapon played a vital role in the subsequent split and independence of
      Anti-Entropy. Originally furnished with an external spherical stabilizer,
      it was severely damaged during battle in 1955. Einstein and Tesla later
      re-designed this Divine Key into a cannon-like device.
