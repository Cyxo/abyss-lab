    description: As a nestling seeing its first sunrise, as an autumn wind picking
      the perfume of flowers;\nAs a fry emerging from its egg, as a road forward
      waving goodbye to its home.\nAnd so the girl came to know that life is
      wandering.\n\nAs a withering taking away memories, as a yearning
      illuminating faces;\n\nAs an extremity sucking on hope, as a darkness
      lighting a glow.\nAnd so the girl came to realize that death is not the
      end.
