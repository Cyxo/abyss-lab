    description: A unique Pantheon-series weapon forged using frost-blue Soulium
      unearthed from the Arctic Ruins. This piece of Soulium was insensitive to
      high temperature and could only be worked at super-conductive states under
      extremely low temperatures. The expedition that first acquired this
      Soulium described that it was like the Goddess of Frost building her own
      crystal palace. When the Soulium was removed, the crystal palace
      immediately collapsed into a pile of ice.
