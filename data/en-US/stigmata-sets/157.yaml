    info: "If a team member is in Inceptive Authority state, the bearer deals
      #1[f1]% more Total DMG. If other team members are in Inceptive Authority
      state provided by the bearer, casting weapon active will refresh Inceptive
      Authority's duration. In Herrscher form, landing a Combo ATK improves
      Inceptive Authority's effect, making all enemies receive #2[f1]% more
      Total DMG for 18s (cannot stack). Triggering it refreshes its duration.
      This effect is immediately lost when Inceptive Authority ends."
