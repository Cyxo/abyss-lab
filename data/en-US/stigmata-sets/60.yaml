      special effects. Mixed Color lasts #1[i]s, during which time no other
      paint can be applied. \\nRed + Yellow = Orange: target takes 30% more
      Physical DMG.\\nRed + Blue = Purple: deals #2[i]% ATK of AOE Physical
      DMG.\\nYellow + Blue = Green: instantly heals the host for #3[i]% HP."
