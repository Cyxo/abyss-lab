    name: Kindred
    info: "When the host scores a crit hit, summons 1 Kindred (summoned entity) that
      lasts #1[i]s, and resets the duration of all existing Kindreds. Kindred
      deals #2[i]% ATK of Physical DMG (DMG calculations are based on the host's
      stats). Up to 3 Kindreds can exist at the same time, and each boosts the
      host's Crit DMG by #3[i]%."
