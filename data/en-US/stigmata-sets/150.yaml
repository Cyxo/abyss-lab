    info: "Gain 1 stack when dealing Bleed DMG to enemies. Upon gaining 10 stacks,
      deal #1[f1]% ATK of Physical DMG to targets, clearing all stacks. This DMG
      counts as Bleed DMG (Can only gain additional stack once every 0.3s, DMG
      CD: #2[f1]s. Unable to gain stacks during CD). When equipped by Starry
      Impression with B-piece, unleashing Ultimate inflicts Structure Outline on
      enemies and enhances team. When Structure Outline ends, Total DMG received
      by all enemies increases by 36% for 12s. Structure Outline enters a 20s
      CD. Can only trigger once in every 20s."

    info: "Wielder gains #1[f1]% ATK Speed. After using Ultimate, when attacking
      enemies with broken or no shield, Total DMG dealt is increased by #2[f1]%
      for every stack of Bleed inflicted on the enemies (maximum of #3[f1]%) for
      20s. This effect cannot stack and triggering it again resets the
      duration."
