    info: "In Herrscher form, Basic/Combo/Charged ATKs deal #1[f1]% more Lightning
      DMG. Triggering Time-frozen Domain generates Thunderfall, making all
      enemies take #2[f1]% more Elemental DMG for 7s. 3 stacks max. This effect
      is exclusive and triggering it again refreshes its duration."

    info: "All enemies take #1[f1]% more Lightning DMG from the character's
      Basic/Combo/Charged ATK (independent and exclusive). After any team member
      casts Joint Bursting in Herrscher form, all enemies enter Listen Well
      state for 10s (triggering it again refreshes the duration), which makes
      them take #2[f1]% more Total DMG (exclusive). Additionally, after such
      enemies are hit by the character's Combo ATK 5 times, they take #3[f1]%
      more Total DMG for 10s (exclusive; triggering it again refreshes the
      duration). Exit clears the counter."
